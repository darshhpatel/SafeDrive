II. LITERATURE SEARCH

--> The number of publications related to computer vision
and autonomous driving is breathtaking. It is impractical
to cover all state-of-the-art (SOTA) papers in this work.

III. BRIEF OVERVIEW OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF AUTONOMOUS DRIVING SYSTEMS

--> Driving automation includes both advanced driver
assistance systems (ADAS) and automated driving systems
(ADS)

ADAS(Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) : 

--> ADAS comprises a set of technologies that provide
drivers with assistance or warnings during the driving process

--> It enhances driving and road safety through a 
safe humanmachine interface

--> ADAS uses technical elements such as
sensors and computer vision algorithms to identify nearby
obstacles or driver errors and take appropriate actions.

--> According to the levels of driving automation released by SAE, levels 1 to 2
are classified as ADAS.

ADS(Automated Driving Systems) :

--> Compared to ADAS, ADS may ultimately be able to perform all
driving functions under certain conditions.

--> According to the levels of driving automation released by SAE, levels 3 to 5
are classified as ADS.

Notable Achievements in the Field of Autonomous Vehicles

1. 1948 – Modern Cruise Control System:
   - Invented by Ralph Teetor, marking the beginning of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS).

2. 1971 – Electronic Cruise Control System:
   - Designed by Daniel Wisner, utilizing electric pulses to maintain a constant vehicle speed.

3. 1984 – NavLab Project at Carnegie Mellon University:
   - CMU started the NavLab project, focusing on using computer vision for autonomous navigation.
   - The project developed the first modern autonomous vehicle featuring Level 1 autonomy.

4. 1987 – Mercedes-Benz Level 2 Autonomous Vehicle:
   - Developed the first Level 2 autonomous vehicle capable of simultaneously controlling steering and acceleration under human supervision.

5. 1990 – Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC):
   - Developed by William Chundrlik and Pamela Labuhn.
   - ACC maintains a predetermined speed when no vehicle is ahead and adjusts speed to keep a specified distance if another vehicle is detected.

6. 1995 – Collision Avoidance System by OnStar:
   - Introduced a system utilizing radar, laser, and vision technologies to detect potential collisions and warn drivers.

7. 2008 – Volvo's Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) System:
   - Volvo’s XC60 was the first vehicle to feature AEB, automatically applying brakes in emergencies.

8. 2010 – Pedestrian Detection with Full Auto Brake by Volvo:
   - This system uses radar and cameras to detect pedestrians ahead of the vehicle and applies brakes if the driver doesn't react in time.

9. 2014 – Tesla's Commercial Autonomous Vehicles:
   - Tesla released the first commercial autonomous vehicles with Autopilot as a standard feature.
   
   Autopilot Features:
   - Includes lane-keep assist and adaptive cruise control.
   - Classified as Level 2 autonomy, requiring drivers to stay alert and ready to take control at any time.
   
   Full Self-Driving (FSD) Capability:
   - In addition to Autopilot's functions, FSD includes features like Navigate on Autopilot, Traffic and Stop Sign Control, and Auto Lane Change.
   - FSD enables vehicles to operate on various types of roads with minimal driver intervention but still falls under Level 2 automation as it requires continuous driver monitoring.

Popular ADAS Features Delivered to the Market

• Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC):
  - A feature that automatically adjusts the vehicle’s speed to maintain a safe distance from the vehicles ahead.

• High Beam Assist (HBA):
  - A feature that automatically switches the headlamp range between high beam and low beam based on the brightness of detected vehicles and road conditions.

• Lane Departure Warning (LDW):
  - A feature that utilizes cameras to monitor lane markings ahead of the vehicle and alerts the driver with visual, audible, or vibration signals if the vehicle deviates from its lane.

• Lane Keep Assist (LKA):
  - A feature that utilizes cameras to monitor the lane markings in front of the vehicle and determine its position within the lane. If the vehicle leaves its lane and the driver fails to take corrective action, the system can automatically provide corrective steering to help keep the car securely in the detected lane.

• Pre-Collision Warning (PCW):
  - A feature that utilizes cameras or radar to detect potential collisions with vehicles or pedestrians ahead. If the system determines that the driver has failed to take evasive action, it can automatically apply the brakes.

• Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR):
  - A feature that recognizes and conveys traffic sign information to drivers via the instrument panel.

• Driver Attention Monitor (DAM):
  - A camera-based technology that tracks driver alertness.

• Traffic Jam Assist (TJA):
  - A feature that uses cameras to monitor lane markings and vehicles ahead. TJA combines the features of ACC and LKA to automatically brake and steer if the driver does not take action in time.
